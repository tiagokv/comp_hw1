# Flex Exercises

This repo contains two examples:

1. ex1.lex: counts the number of words, different words and phrases of a file
2. ex2.lex: pass .java files and it identifies the class and its public methods

You can create your executable file just executing:

bash makeflex.sh <just_the_name_of_lex_file>
e.g. bash makeflex.sh ex1

To execute on a specific file, just call ./ex1 lorem_ipsum
